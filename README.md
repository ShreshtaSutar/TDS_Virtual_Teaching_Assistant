## 📘 Overview

The **TDS Virtual Teaching Assistant** automates the process of answering student questions on the **TDS Discourse forum** using AI.
It leverages **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to fetch relevant course and forum data and produce context-aware, accurate answers — acting like a human teaching assistant.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build a scalable and intelligent teaching assistant.
* Automate responses to student queries using course and forum data.
* Provide explainable and reference-linked answers.
* Reduce workload for teaching assistants and improve query turnaround time.

---

## 🧩 Features

✅ **Automated Query Response** — Uses embeddings and GPT-based models to generate answers.
✅ **RAG Pipeline** — Fetches most relevant course or Discourse content before responding.
✅ **Multimodal Support** — Handles both text and image-based queries.
✅ **Source Transparency** — Each answer includes verified links to sources.
✅ **API-Based Architecture** — Built using FastAPI for easy integration.
✅ **Health Endpoint** — Provides system and database health status.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

**Preprocessing Phase**

* Parses and cleans **Discourse forum posts** and **course markdown content**.
* Splits data into contextual **text chunks** with overlapping windows.
* Generates embeddings using the **OpenAI text-embedding-3-small** model.
* Stores chunks and embeddings in **SQLite (`knowledge_base.db`)**.

**Query Phase**

1. User sends a question (and optionally an image).
2. Query embedding is generated.
3. Similar content is retrieved via cosine similarity.
4. Context is passed to the **GPT-4o-mini** model for generating an accurate, source-linked answer.
5. The API returns a JSON response with `answer` and `sources`.

}
```

---

## 💡 Example Response

```json
{
  "answer": "Pandas is a Python library used in the Tools in Data Science course for data manipulation and analysis.",
  "links": [
    {
      "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/pandas-basics/12345",
      "text": "Introduction to Pandas library and its DataFrame structure."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example Interaction

| **Query** | **Response** |
|----------|--------------|
| **Is this course really very hard?** <br><br> ![Question Example](images/query_example.png) | **Yes, this course is considered very hard. Feedback from students indicates that it has become significantly more difficult compared to previous terms, with many students struggling to pass. The course requires more time than typical 3-credit courses, and assessments are described as challenging, particularly the remote open exams and the final in-person exam. Additionally, the unpredictability of grading by LLMs adds to the difficulty level.** <br><br> ![Answer Example](images/response_example.png) |

> The assistant retrieves relevant course and discourse content to answer queries intelligently.
