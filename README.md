# 🧠 TDS Virtual Teaching Assistant

An intelligent **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**-based **Virtual Teaching Assistant** built to automatically respond to student queries for the **Tools in Data Science (TDS)** course under the **IIT Madras Online B.Sc. Degree in Data Science** program.

---

## 📘 Overview

The **TDS Virtual Teaching Assistant** automates the process of answering student questions on the **TDS Discourse forum** using AI.
It leverages **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to fetch relevant course and forum data and produce context-aware, accurate answers — acting like a human teaching assistant.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build a scalable and intelligent teaching assistant.
* Automate responses to student queries using course and forum data.
* Provide explainable and reference-linked answers.
* Reduce workload for teaching assistants and improve query turnaround time.

---

## 🧩 Features

✅ **Automated Query Response** — Uses embeddings and GPT-based models to generate answers.
✅ **RAG Pipeline** — Fetches most relevant course or Discourse content before responding.
✅ **Multimodal Support** — Handles both text and image-based queries.
✅ **Source Transparency** — Each answer includes verified links to sources.
✅ **API-Based Architecture** — Built using FastAPI for easy integration.
✅ **Health Endpoint** — Provides system and database health status.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

**Preprocessing Phase**

* Parses and cleans **Discourse forum posts** and **course markdown content**.
* Splits data into contextual **text chunks** with overlapping windows.
* Generates embeddings using the **OpenAI text-embedding-3-small** model.
* Stores chunks and embeddings in **SQLite (`knowledge_base.db`)**.

**Query Phase**

1. User sends a question (and optionally an image).
2. Query embedding is generated.
3. Similar content is retrieved via cosine similarity.
4. Context is passed to the **GPT-4o-mini** model for generating an accurate, source-linked answer.
5. The API returns a JSON response with `answer` and `sources`.

## 🧠 API Endpoints

| Method   | Endpoint  | Description                                                                            |
| -------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **POST** | `/query`  | Takes a question (and optional image) and returns an AI-generated answer with sources. |
| **GET**  | `/health` | Checks API status, database connection, and embedding counts.                          |

Example query:

```json
{
  "question": "What is pandas used for in the TDS course?"
}
```

---

## 💡 Example Response

```json
{
  "answer": "Pandas is a Python library used in the Tools in Data Science course for data manipulation and analysis.",
  "links": [
    {
      "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/pandas-basics/12345",
      "text": "Introduction to Pandas library and its DataFrame structure."
    }
  ]
}
```
